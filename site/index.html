          Layout ONE: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3
          sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you
          make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become
          wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the
          'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this
          view, see the desktop mockup illustration below.
